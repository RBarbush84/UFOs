## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage using HTML, JavaScript and CSS to display a dynamic table with UFO sighting data, with the ability to filter which results of the table are displayed based on different criteria in the table.

## Results
The final website allows users to filter the UFO sighting data across five different criteria: Date, City, State, Country and Sighting Shape.
