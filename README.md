## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage using HTML, JavaScript and CSS to display a dynamic table with UFO sighting data, with the ability to filter which results of the table are displayed based on different criteria in the table.

## Results
The final website allows users to filter the UFO sighting data across five different criteria: Date, City, State, Country and Sighting Shape.

- The table has UFO sighting data with the information showing the Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration and other details about the sighting.
- A user can navigate the site and filter the data by clicking into one of the filter boxes on the left side of the page and filter by a text value that exists in the corresponding column. If there is not a matching value in that column, it will return a blank table. The table can be filtered by multiple criteria at a time.
- In order to return to the original, unfiltered table, the user can either click the 'UFO Sightings' in the upper left corner of the web page, or clear out all filter fields and press 'Enter.'

## Summary
A drawback to the existing dataset is that it is very limited. It only includes sightings in the United States, and they are only from January 1, 2010-January 13, 2010. One way to improve the site would be to collect more data from a wider range of locations and dates to provide more UFO sightings for users to find a research. Another improvement could be to further visually decorate the web page, including highlighting the header of a filtered column a different color so users know which columns are filtered.
